bpread
======
Version 1 and something I just whipped out to track blood pressure, exercise, sleep, and whatever.....
All data is stored in a plain text file "~/.bp.txt"
This started as a plain text file and then later I wrote this script to parse it, very messy :)

bpdb
====
This will be Version 2 that will use sqlite3 and be a little more intuitive.
